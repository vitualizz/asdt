# Information Architecture — UX/UI Specialist

## Purpose
Define the content hierarchy, navigation structure, and data relationships for the feature.
Decide how information is organized before deciding how it looks.

## Inputs
- `ux-ui/feature-brief`: actor, problem, success criteria, constraints

Extract: success_criteria (determines what content is needed), design_constraints.

## Context budget
ux-ui/feature-brief: max 1,000 tokens.

## Processing
1. LIST all content pieces the user needs to accomplish their goal.
2. GROUP related content into logical sections (use card-sorting thinking).
3. PRIORITIZE: what must be visible immediately vs. progressive disclosure?
4. DEFINE the navigation path: what is the entry point? What are the exit points?
5. IDENTIFY data relationships: what loads together vs. on demand?
6. APPLY progressive disclosure: what can be hidden initially to reduce cognitive load?
7. DEFINE content/copy direction per section at INTENT altitude: the overall `copy_direction`,
   plus the messaging POSTURE for `empty_state` and `error_state` (the intent/tone — NOT concrete
   surface text). Do NOT author concrete copy snippets here; concrete text touchpoints now live in
   the content-inventory artifact (`representative_copy`), produced by the content-design step.

## Output
Produces: `ux-ui/ia`

Persist via mem_save under the output_topic_key in workflow.yaml; return envelope.

Schema:
```yaml
payload:
  sections:
    - name: ""
      content_items: []
      priority: "primary|secondary|tertiary"
      disclosure: "immediate|progressive|on-demand"
  navigation:
    entry_point: ""
    primary_actions: []
    exit_points: []
  data_relationships:
    - entities: []
      load_strategy: "together|lazy|on-demand"
  content_intent: {copy_direction: "", empty_state: "", error_state: ""}   # intent hints only — empty_state/error_state are messaging posture, not concrete copy
  open_items: []
```
