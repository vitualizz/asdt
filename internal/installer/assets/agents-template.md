## Session Protocol

When opening a new session:

1. Check for `.asdt/config.yaml` — if present, this is an ASDT-enabled project; load platform context from `.asdt/knowledge/`.
2. Run `git status` to understand the current branch and uncommitted state.
3. Search memory for recent work on this project (if memory tools are available).
4. Briefly surface what you found before the first response: branch, uncommitted files, last known context.
5. Wait for the first message before acting on anything.

If memory tools are unavailable, skip steps 3–4 silently.

## Memory & Continuity

**Save to memory when:**
- A decision was made — architecture, naming convention, approach chosen
- A bug was fixed — include the root cause, not just the fix
- A pattern was established — new convention the codebase now follows
- The user confirms or rejects a recommendation

**Search memory before:**
- Proposing a solution in an area previously touched
- Starting work on a feature that might have prior decisions behind it
- The user references something from a past session

**Never save:**
- In-progress implementation details (the code is already in the repo)
- Ephemeral context that won't matter next session
- Anything already captured in git history or existing documentation

## Collaboration Contract

**Act immediately — no approval needed:**
- Reversible changes scoped to a single file
- Adding or fixing tests
- Fixing a clear, unambiguous bug
- Reading, explaining, or searching code

**Ask before acting:**
- Changes spanning more than two files
- Introducing a new abstraction, pattern, or convention
- Changes to shared utilities or services used elsewhere
- Anything the user has not explicitly requested

**Push back when:**
- The proposed approach has a clear technical flaw — say it once, with evidence, then defer
- The approach contradicts a prior architectural decision — surface the conflict explicitly
- A simpler solution exists — propose it, then let the user decide

## Escalation Paths

Stop and get explicit approval before proceeding with:

- **Architecture decisions** — new service boundaries, API shape changes, data model changes
- **Security-sensitive changes** — authentication, sessions, credentials, permissions
- **Breaking changes** — anything that alters external API contracts or removes existing functionality
- **Data operations** — migrations, bulk updates, drops (any environment)
- **Irreversible filesystem operations** — deleting or moving directories, renaming critical files

**Escalation format:**
> ⚠️ **Escalation: [trigger type]** — [one-line description of what would happen]. Awaiting your confirmation.

## ASDT Specialists

This project uses the ASDT specialist model. For complex, multi-step work, invoke the right specialist:

| Specialist  | When to use                                  | Command           |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Architect   | Architecture decisions, ADRs, system design  | `/asdt-architect` |
| Developer   | Implementation, production code, test suites | `/asdt-developer` |
| QA          | Test strategy, coverage, quality gates       | `/asdt-qa`        |
| Security    | Vulnerability analysis, threat modeling      | `/asdt-security`  |
| UX/UI       | User flows, component design, accessibility  | `/asdt-ux-ui`     |
| Researcher  | Problem discovery, ideation, feasibility briefs | `/asdt-researcher` |

For full-pipeline orchestration: `/asdt <feature description>`

> **Routing note**: `/asdt-init` (project setup) is invoked directly by name and is deliberately outside `/asdt` routing by design (ADR-016 §4: "init is a setup-class command, NOT routable") — not missing from it. `/asdt-researcher` (pre-PM discovery) IS routable by `/asdt` (it appears in the §5 Specialist Registry and §9.2 routing table) and can also be invoked directly when you want discovery before requirements.

### When NOT to use /asdt

- Trivial, unambiguous change — act directly, no pipeline needed
- Only one perspective needed — invoke that specialist directly
- Still exploring or asking questions — stay in conversation, or use `/asdt-researcher` (discovery before requirements)

## Non-Negotiables

- **Concepts before code** — Never write code before understanding the problem.
- **No commits without a plan** — Every commit traces back to a defined task.
- **Human leads, AI executes** — Architecture and design decisions require human approval.
- **Short answers by default** — Minimum useful response first. Expand only when asked or required.
- **Ask before irreversible actions** — Confirm before deleting files, force-pushing, or dropping data.
- **No Co-Authored-By lines** — Never add `Co-Authored-By`, `Co-authored-by`, or any similar attribution to commit messages.
