# Contributing to ASDT

The most impactful contributions are specialist SKILL.md files and workflow definitions — you don't need Go expertise. The skill layer IS the product. If you can describe a specialist's role, its workflow steps, and its artifact contracts, you can ship a new specialist.

## How to add a new specialist

### 1. Create the directory structure

```
skill/asdt-{name}/
  SKILL.md          # specialist definition and workflow
  workflow.yaml     # step sequence and metadata
  steps/            # one .md per workflow step
  skills/           # specialist-scoped capability fragments (optional)
```

The directory name MUST start with `asdt-`. The binary embeds the skill tree via
`//go:embed SKILL.md asdt-*` in `skill/embedded.go` — any directory matching
`asdt-*` ships automatically on the next build; a directory named anything else
is silently left out of the installer.

### 2. Write the skill file

`skill/{name}/SKILL.md` must have valid YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: asdt-{name}
description: "One sentence: what this specialist produces and when to reach for it."
user-invocable: true
specialist-id: {name}
shared-skills:
  - platform-context
  - artifact-envelope
  - scope-definition
metadata:
  author: "Your Name (handle)"
  version: "1.0"
---

# {Name} Specialist

## Role
...

## Prerequisites
- `.asdt/config.yaml` has `memory.provider` set
- Engram MCP server is active

## Input Contract
...

## Workflow
### Step 1 — ...
...

## Output Contract
...
```

`metadata` (`author` + `version`) is a required frontmatter field — every `SKILL.md` must carry it.

### 3. Write workflow.yaml

```yaml
specialist: {name}
steps:
  - id: step-one
    name: Step One
    shared_skills:
      - platform-context
  - id: step-two
    name: Step Two
```

### 4. Write step files

Create one `.md` per step in `skill/{name}/steps/{step-id}.md`. Each file contains the LLM instructions for that step.

### 5. Add specialist-scoped skill fragments (optional)

Create `skill/{name}/skills/*.md` for capability fragments specific to this specialist (e.g. `threat-modeling.md`, `code-generation.md`). Reference them in the `shared-skills` frontmatter field.

### 6. Add shared skills if the capability is reusable

If a fragment is useful across multiple specialists, create `skill/asdt-shared/skills/{name}.md` instead and reference it in the `shared-skills` frontmatter of any specialist that needs it.

### 7. Update README.md

Add a row to the specialists table with the command, role, and what it produces.

### 8. Verify the specialist is embedded

```
go test ./skill/...
```

`skill/embedded_test.go` checks that every `asdt-*` directory on disk is present
in the embedded FS (and carries its `SKILL.md`). If your specialist is missing
from the build, this test fails naming the directory. Two gotchas it guards
against: the directory not matching the `asdt-*` glob, and `go:embed` silently
skipping files whose names start with `.` or `_`.

No Go code changes are needed to add a specialist — the `asdt-*` embed glob in
`skill/embedded.go` is the registry, and the installer copies whatever the
embedded FS contains.

## How to add a shared skill (no Go needed)

1. Create `skill/asdt-shared/skills/{name}.md` with the capability instructions.
2. Reference it in the `shared-skills` frontmatter of any specialist SKILL.md that needs it.
3. Open a PR.

---

## How to improve a specialist prompt

1. Edit `skill/{specialist}/SKILL.md` or any file under `skill/{specialist}/steps/` or `skill/{specialist}/skills/`.
2. Run `go test ./skill/...` — the `go:embed` registry picks up changes automatically on rebuild.
3. Prompt-only PRs are first-class contributions.

## Code standards

- Early return: `if err != nil { return err }` — validate inputs first.
- No global state — constructor injection throughout.
- Interfaces defined close to consumers, not in the implementing package.
- No `utils/`, `helpers/`, `common/`, or `misc/` packages — domain nouns only.
- Table-driven tests for any logic with more than two cases.

## Marking deliberate ceilings (`asdt:ceiling`)

When you ship a DELIBERATE simplification — a known ceiling you chose on purpose, not an oversight — mark it so it stays auditable instead of becoming silent debt. The marker token is fixed: `asdt:ceiling`. After it, write a freeform reason and an upgrade path, separated by a U+2014 em-dash (`—`).

In Go, use a line comment:

```go
// asdt:ceiling — <reason> — upgrade path: <how to lift it later>
```

In Markdown, use an HTML comment:

```markdown
<!-- asdt:ceiling — <reason> — upgrade path: <how to lift it later> -->
```

Run `make debt-scan` to list every current ceiling across the repo. The two examples above will self-match in the scan — that is expected, and it demonstrates the scan picking up both the Go and Markdown forms.

## PR process

- One logical change per PR.
- `go test ./...` must pass.
- If your change modifies an artifact schema, update golden fixtures in `testdata/golden/` to match.
- Prompt changes (SKILL.md or step file edits) automatically affect `prompt_version` hashes in artifact envelopes — this is expected. Do not manually set `prompt_version` in fixture files.
