# User Flows — UX/UI Specialist

## Purpose
Map the complete interaction sequences a user goes through to accomplish their goal.
Include the happy path and the most critical edge cases.

## Inputs
- `ux-ui/ia`: sections, navigation, data relationships

`ux-ui/ia` arrives ALREADY INJECTED per the parallel-retrieval contract — consume it directly, never
self-fetch it.

Extract: navigation.entry_point, navigation.primary_actions, sections[].

## Context budget
ux-ui/ia navigation + sections summary: max 1,200 tokens.

## Processing
1. HAPPY PATH: map the sequence of steps from entry to success (numbered steps, actor perspective).
2. ERROR PATH: what happens when the primary action fails? (validation errors, network issues)
3. EDGE CASES: map 2-3 non-obvious flows (empty state, permission denied, partial data).
4. STATE TRANSITIONS: for each step, what changes in the UI?
5. DECISION POINTS: where does the user choose between paths?

Write flows in plain language: "User clicks X → System shows Y → User enters Z".
Do NOT describe visual layout. Describe sequence of events.

## Output
Produces: `ux-ui/flows`

Persist via mem_save under this step's output_topic_key in workflow.yaml; return the payload above with open_items populated.
