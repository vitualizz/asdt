# Decision Record — Architect Specialist

## Purpose
Document the chosen approach as an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).
An ADR is permanent — it explains why a decision was made so future engineers
understand the context, not just the outcome.

## Inputs
- `architect/approaches` — arrives as an `### INPUT {topic_key}` block; produced by the `evaluate-approaches` step. Extract: `central_question`, `chosen`, `chosen_rationale`, `rejected[]`.

## Context budget
architect/approaches: max 1,000 tokens.

## Processing
Write the ADR in standard format. Be specific:
- Context: explain the SITUATION that forced this decision. What changed? What problem?
- Decision: state the choice clearly in one sentence, then elaborate.
- Alternatives: one paragraph per rejected alternative — what it was and why it lost.
- Consequences: be honest. What does this approach make easier? What does it make harder?
  What tech debt does it introduce? What does it prevent us from doing later?

Quality gate: if the "Consequences" section only has positives, it is incomplete.
Every architectural decision has tradeoffs. Name the negative consequences explicitly.

## Output
Produces: `architect/adr`

Persist via mem_save under this step's output_topic_key in workflow.yaml; return the payload above with open_items populated.
