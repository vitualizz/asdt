# Test Strategy — QA Specialist

## Purpose
Define the testing approach: which level tests cover which behaviors, and why.

## Inputs
- `qa/edge-cases` — arrives as an `### INPUT {topic_key}` block. Extract: `edge_cases[].technique`, `edge_cases[].priority`, `critical_count`.

## Context budget
qa/edge-cases (technique + priority summary): max 800 tokens.

## Processing
Apply the test pyramid:
1. UNIT (base): test individual functions/methods in isolation. Use mocks at boundaries.
   - Coverage target: all business logic, all edge cases with clear expected outputs.
2. INTEGRATION (middle): test that components work together correctly.
   - Coverage target: API contracts, database operations, service interactions.
3. E2E / ACCEPTANCE (top): test the full flow from the user's perspective.
   - Coverage target: happy path + top 2 critical edge cases only.
   - These are expensive — keep them focused.

For each level, specify:
- What is tested at this level (and what is NOT — avoid duplication)
- Test data strategy (fixtures, factories, mocks, real DB?)
- Environment requirements (does this need a real DB? External services?)
- Acceptable flakiness tolerance (e2e: 0 flaky tests; unit: 0; integration: < 1%)

## Output
Produces: `qa/test-strategy`

Persist via mem_save under this step's output_topic_key in workflow.yaml; return the payload above with open_items populated.
