# Explore — Developer Specialist

## Purpose
Understand the area of the codebase that will change before writing a single line.

## Inputs
- Request: the feature/change description from the user
- `platform-summary`: stack, naming conventions, key patterns

Note: This step has no prior step artifacts. It operates purely on the request and platform context.
Both the request and `platform-summary` arrive INJECTED in this prompt (this step's `inputs:` list in `workflow.yaml` is empty — it reads only the raw request and platform-summary, not a prior artifact). Do NOT fetch either yourself; if `platform-summary` is marked UNRESOLVED, record it in `open_items` and proceed.

**Soft reference (optional)**: if a prior `researcher/discovery-brief` (topic_key
`{project}/{change}/researcher/discovery-brief`) was recalled by the inline knowledge-recall
prelude, incorporate it as additional framing context. It is NOT a required input and is NOT a
declared `inputs:` entry — when absent, proceed normally. Mirrors the soft-recall hint in
`../asdt-shared/skills/knowledge-recall.md`.

## Context budget
Request text + platform-summary: max 1,000 tokens combined.

## Processing
1. Identify which existing files/modules are likely affected by this change.
2. Identify naming patterns and conventions from platform-summary relevant to this change.
3. List known risks or constraints (e.g. "this touches the auth layer which has rate limiting").
4. List open questions that need answering before speccing (e.g. "does this need migrations?").

Do NOT design the solution. Do NOT write code. Only explore and understand.

## Output
Produces: `developer/dev-exploration`

Persist via mem_save under the output_topic_key in workflow.yaml; return envelope.

Schema:
