# Information Architecture — UX/UI Specialist

## Purpose
Define the content hierarchy, navigation structure, and data relationships for the feature.
Decide how information is organized before deciding how it looks.

## Inputs
- `ux-ui/feature-brief`: actor, problem, success criteria, constraints

Extract: success_criteria (determines what content is needed), design_constraints.

## Context budget
ux-ui/feature-brief: max 1,000 tokens.

## Processing
1. LIST all content pieces the user needs to accomplish their goal.
2. GROUP related content into logical sections (use card-sorting thinking).
3. PRIORITIZE: what must be visible immediately vs. progressive disclosure?
4. DEFINE the navigation path: what is the entry point? What are the exit points?
5. IDENTIFY data relationships: what loads together vs. on demand?
6. APPLY progressive disclosure: what can be hidden initially to reduce cognitive load?
7. DEFINE content/copy direction per section: the overall `copy_direction`, key `microcopy`
   snippets, and the `empty_state` and `error_state` messaging guidance.

## Output
Produces: `ux-ui/ia`

Persist via mem_save under the output_topic_key in workflow.yaml; return envelope.
