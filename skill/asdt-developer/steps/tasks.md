# Tasks — Developer Specialist

## Purpose
Break the implementation into an ordered checklist of atomic tasks.

## Inputs
- `developer/dev-spec`: scope, acceptance criteria
- `developer/dev-design`: technical approach, data model, API surface

Extract from dev-spec: `acceptance_criteria`, `scope.in`.
Extract from dev-design: `data_model`, `api_surface`, `key_constraints`.

## Context budget
dev-spec summary + dev-design summary: max 2,500 tokens combined.

## Processing
1. Break the implementation into atomic tasks (each completable in < 2h).
2. Order tasks by dependency (models before controllers, etc.).
3. Assign each task a unique ID: T-001, T-002, etc.
4. Estimate each task: S (< 30m), M (30m-2h), L (2h-4h).
5. Map each task to an acceptance criterion it satisfies.

## Output
Produces: `developer/dev-tasks`

Persist via mem_save under this step's output_topic_key in workflow.yaml; return the payload above with open_items populated.

```yaml
payload:
  tasks:
    - id: "T-001"
      title: ""
      files_to_create: []
      files_to_modify: []
      ac_ref: ""        # which acceptance criterion this satisfies
      estimate: "S|M|L"
      depends_on: []    # other task IDs
  total_estimate: ""
  open_items: []
```
